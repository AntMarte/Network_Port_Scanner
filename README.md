# Network_Port_Scanner

A tool used to discover open ports on a target system or network.

## Features

- Scans a range of ports on a target host
- Determines if each port is open or closed
- Provides basic error handling for network connections

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `port_scanner.py` file is located.

3. Run the script using the following command:

python3 port_scanner.py


4. Follow the prompts to enter the target host, starting port, and ending port.

5. The script will scan each port in the specified range and display the results.

## Example

Here's an example usage of the script:

Enter the target host: 127.0.0.1
Enter the starting port: 80
Enter the ending port: 100
Port 80: Closed
Port 81: Closed
Port 82: Closed
Port 83: Closed
Port 84: Closed
Port 85: Closed
Port 86: Closed
Port 87: Closed
Port 88: Closed
Port 89: Closed
Port 90: Closed
Port 91: Closed
Port 92: Closed
Port 93: Closed
Port 94: Closed
Port 95: Closed
Port 96: Closed
Port 97: Closed
Port 98: Closed
Port 99: Closed
Port 100: Closed


The script will then attempt to establish a connection to each port in the range and display whether it is "Open" or "Closed" for the target host.
